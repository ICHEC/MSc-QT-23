Hi all! 

As promised, I have pushed the solutions to the repo, both the original version (<code>PyQM_Tut.5_sol.ipynb</code>) and the version which I commented (<code>PyQM_Tut.5_sol_comments.ipynb</code>) as per your request, which is the one I printed to help me in delivering the session. I have also pushed the solutions to this week's exercises (<code>PyQM_Ex.5_sol.ipynb</code>), as well as the exercises and tutorial for next week, which you will find in the <code>pyqm-week6</code> folder.

If you use/want to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to run the notebooks, I have exported the Conda environment I used, which will allow you to run the animated plots. To install this environment first install [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
 if you haven't yet, and then in a terminal run:

<pre>
conda env create -f pyqm.yml
</pre>

This will then create a Conda environment named <code>pyqm</code>. You can now select this environment as the kernel for the solutions Jupyter Notebook in VS Code, all cells should run and all plots should be reproduced without issues. I recommend you all familiarise yourself with VS Code and Conda, you will more likely than not end up using them a lot in your careers.

Given that we didn't have time to properly cover Ex. 4 and we didn't touch on Ex.5, please feel free to email me at [pablo.lauret@ichec.ie](mailto:pablo.lauret@ichec.ie) with 'PyQM' in the beginning of the subject. I'll be more than happy to help with any questions, whether they are related to those two questions, any of the other ones, or if you need help setting up the environment on VS Code. 

Thank you all for coming today, was great to get to have a session with you guys. Good luck with the rest of your masters!

Pablo
